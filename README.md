## About folder structure and a short note
### In the `src` directory:

> **assets** folder, We have all static images and global CSS

> **components** folder, we have all components, that are unit building blocks for our app. In the component folder, there are three files: **1.** index.tsx - for component, **2.** index.scss - for css, **3.** types.tsx - for defining types

> **Screens** folder, we have all screens/mainContent components here, we will use them for several screens/mainContent like first step, second step, configuration, and others static tabs. there are three files maximum: **1.** index.tsx - for component, **2.** index.scss - for css, **3.** types.tsx - for defining types

> **utils** folder, we have a helper functions file, we use this file for different custom helper and used those functions throughout the app. Like: Toast, localstorage management etc
